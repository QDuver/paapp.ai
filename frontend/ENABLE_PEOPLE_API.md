# 🎉 Almost There! Enable People API

## ✅ Good News
Your OAuth client ID is working! You successfully got an access token from Google.

## ❗ What You Need to Do Now
Enable the Google People API in your project:

### Step 1: Enable People API
1. **Click this link**: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/people.googleapis.com/overview?project=1050310982145
2. Click the **"ENABLE"** button
3. Wait for it to be enabled (should take a few seconds)

### Step 2: Test Again
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🔍 What This API Does
The People API allows your app to:
- Get user profile information (name, email, photo)
- Access Google contacts (if you request permission)

For basic authentication, you only need the profile info.

## ✅ Expected Result
After enabling the People API:
1. Google Sign-In popup works ✅ (already working)
2. User can select their account ✅ (already working)
3. User profile information loads ✅ (will work after enabling API)
4. User is redirected to your app's main screen ✅

## 🚨 If You Get Another API Error
Some other APIs you might need to enable:
- **Google+ API** (sometimes required)
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM) API**

But the People API should be sufficient for basic Google Sign-In.

## 🎯 Alternative: Simplified Approach
If you continue having API issues, we can modify the authentication to not fetch additional profile data and just use what Firebase provides directly.
