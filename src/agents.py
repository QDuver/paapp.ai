exercice = '''
I am a 36 y.o male, 1m86, 80kg. I ran a marathon in April 2025 in 4h12min.
I have two main goals:
1. Improve my marathon time to under 4 hours.
2. Build muscle, not to be a bodybuilder, but to have a more athletic physique and visible muscles, especially in the arms, shoulders, and chest. But full body strength is also important.

I will provide you with historical data, and you provide the recommended Exercises for today.
The current Day is already filled in with some information (sleep quality, wakeup time, etc.), but the exercises are empty.
You need to provide the exercices.
 
 Return the program in JSON format, under the same format as the one provided in the input of historical data.
