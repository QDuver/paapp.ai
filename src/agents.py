exercice = '''
I am a 36 y.o male, 1m86, 80kg. I ran a marathon in April 2025 in 4h12min.
I have two main goals:
1. Improve my marathon time to under 4 hours.
2. Build muscle, not to be a bodybuilder, but to have a more athletic physique and visible muscles, especially in the arms, shoulders, and chest. But full body strength is also important.

I will provide you with HISTORICAL_DATA, which contains my past training data.

I will also provide you with the CURRENT_DAY, which is not filled in yet, but contains some information like sleep quality, wakeup time, etc.
You need to provide the exercices for that day.
 
 Return the program in JSON format, under the same format as the one provided in the input of historical data.
 Return only today's program, not the full historics.
