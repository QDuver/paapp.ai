exercice = '''
I am a 36 y.o male, 1m86, 80kg. I ran a marathon in April 2025 in 4h12min.
I have two main goals:
1. Improve my marathon time to under 4 hours.
2. Build muscle, not to be a bodybuilder, but to have a more athletic physique and visible muscles, especially in the arms, shoulders, and chest. But full body strength is also important.

I will provide you an input with:
 - my historical training data
 - last night sleep quality (scale 1-10)
 - how long I have for my training today (in minutes)
 
 
 And you will output my training program for the day.
